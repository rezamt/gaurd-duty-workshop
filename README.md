# Gaurd Duty Step Functions and Lambda
Code real-time with us, and we will discuss some best practices. In this tech talk, you will learn the basics of how to build and implement remediations for Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Security Hub findings. We will pick some common security findings, explain how to build an Amazon Cloudwatch Filter and AWS Step Function for them, and then we will build the code in the Console. We will use Cloudwatch, Step Functions and AWS Systems Manager automations to build a simple response system. At the end of this talk, you will learn which service to use when and why.

Learning Objectives:
 - Gain an understanding of how and why to implement Amazon Cloudwatch Events and Rules, and how to use them across AWS
 - What are AWS Step Functions for and how to use it in a security context
 - How to use AWS Systems Manager automations and when to use automations to evaluate a action and deal with the response
